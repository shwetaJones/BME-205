    "The program uses a string x, followed by the alphabet Σ from which x was constructed, followed by a hidden path π, followed by the states States and emission matrix Emission of an HMM (Σ, States, Transition, Emission). It returns the conditional probability Pr(x|π) that string x will be emitted by the HMM given the hidden path π.\n",
